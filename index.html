			<h2>About Luffy</h2>
			<p> Luffy is portrayed as a carefree, happy-go-lucky character with great ambition and a huge appetite, often thinking with his stomach and comically gorging himself. Caring and generally good-hearted, he is not as dimwitted as many believe him to be and often demonstrates more understanding than the other characters expect. Knowing the danger ahead, Luffy is willing to risk his life to become King of the Pirates and protect his crew. A capable and reliable captain, he never puts his crew or himself at risk out of incompetence. During the Loguetown story arc, Smoker (a navy captain at the time) says that Luffy "enjoys playing stupid"; Luffy responds with a mysterious smile.</p>
